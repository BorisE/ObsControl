to do:
- stability issues when closing some programs
- separate threads for starting  programs with realtime info displaying into log (????)
- reading data from weatherstation
- parsing CCDAP activity and send it to server
- check internet connection (ping) during startup
- ip cameras displaying
- web cameras displaying
- communicating with watchdog on router
- ability to detect unhandle shutdown at startup and park observatory
- network command reading and responding
- web platform for remote control
- maxim tracking data parsing

0.5.0 [12.09.16]
- more accent into applications:
	- reorganizing code (more object oriented)
	- application set represents recent workflow (PHD2, etc)
