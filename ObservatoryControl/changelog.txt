to do:
- parsing CCDAP activity and send it to server
- abort button
- run PAM throug AutoIt
- implement focusing throug FocusMax
- calculate and set suitable cooling temp
- SafetyModule: check enviroment for open roof
- SafetyModule: check enviroment when opened roof
- SafetyModule: telescope postion
- check internet connection (vpn) during startup
- ip cameras displaying
- web cameras displaying
- communicating with watchdog on router
- ability to detect unhandle shutdown at startup and park observatory
- network command reading and responding
- web platform for remote control

bugs:
- roof animation strange flickering
- unkown excetption reason on Dome Connect!!!! to resolve
